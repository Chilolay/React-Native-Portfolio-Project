# Game Finder

Game Finder is a React Native application that utilizes a comprehensive database of tabletop games meant to help you find your next game match. The goal of this project was to help tabletop game lovers find the perfect game based on any criteria you can think of. In the future I will be implementing more features such as lists of where to purchase specific games with links, more information on first view of the game cards, and perfecting the site styles to make a neater UI. 

Currently there a few layout issues on certain screens that need to be fixed such as card title and button spacing and where the dropdown menu renders in comparison to its selection element.

## Features
- Home page has featured or staff favorite games
- Category search dropdown for game categories
- Search bar for more specific game search
- Game descriptions including play time, number of players etc.
- Link to chosen games URL to learn more

##### Board Game Atlas API
This is a REST API and it is here for you to access and use the compilation of all known board game data that is available. There are many things you can do with the REST API. Here are some examples.

Create a mobile app that can access and use the data.
Make a website that can show and use all the board game data from the API.
You can download and analyze the information in your own way.
Nearly any application language can access and use the API.
Board Game Atlas provides our data free of charge for the purpose of creating commercial or non-commercial Board Game software, performing research, or creating community content like videos and reviews.

See the API in action in our own implementation of a powerful board game search web app. The [Board Game Atlas Search](https://www.boardgameatlas.com/search/).
